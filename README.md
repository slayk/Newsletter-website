# K-Daily Newsletter Website

Newsletter Website Application is based on the idea of making blog readers receive mails from the author.
- This application is based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- It has a sign up page in which the user will need to enter their name and email address.
- Once the user clicks on the "Sign up" button and it's successful, the success page shows up.
- If the user clicks on the "Sign up" button and it's not successful, the failure page shows up.
- Here, I have made use of the MailChimp API. 
Have a look at the MailChimp website to get their documentation and related information: https://mailchimp.com/developer/
- All the data gets stored on the MailChimp database.
- Now, the author can just fetch the email addresses and send motivational or important mails to their readers.
